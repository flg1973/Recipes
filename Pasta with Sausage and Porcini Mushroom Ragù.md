Start to finish: 40 minutes

Servings: 4 to 6

12 ounces dried pappardelle or tagliatelle pasta

Kosher salt and ground black pepper

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided

1 pound fresh turkey or chicken Italian sausage (see headnote), casing removed

1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped

1 medium carrot, peeled and finely chopped

2 medium garlic cloves, chopped

1 ounce dried porcini mushrooms, broken into small pieces, rinsed and drained

1 cup dry white wine

¼ cup heavy cream

1 ounce Parmesan cheese, finely grated, (½ cup) plus more to serve

½ cup lightly packed fresh basil, roughly chopped

In a large pot, bring 4 quarts water to a boil. Add the pasta and 1 tablespoon salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Reserve 1½ cups of the pasta cooking water, then drain and return the pasta to the pot. Toss with 1 tablespoon of oil; set aside.

Meanwhile, in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons oil until shimmering. Add the sausage and cook, breaking it into small bits, until no longer pink, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the onion, carrot, garlic, and ½ teaspoon each salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms, then add the wine and scrape up any browned bits. Add 1 cup of the reserved pasta water and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the cream and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute.

Pour the sauce over the pasta and add the Parmesan. Cook over medium, stirring often, until the sauce clings to the pasta, about 2 minutes; add reserved pasta water 2 tablespoons at a time if needed so the sauce coats the noodles. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Serve sprinkled with the basil and additional Parmesan.
